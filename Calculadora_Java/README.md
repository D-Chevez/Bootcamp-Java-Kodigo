# 🧮 Java Console Calculator

This project implements a **console-based calculator in Java** using object-oriented programming principles, designed for academic practice and structured, clean coding.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Perform **basic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.  
✅ Perform **power** and **square root** operations.  
✅ Handles **exception cases** such as division by zero and square root of negative numbers.  
✅ **Input validation** to handle invalid entries without crashing.  
✅ **In-memory history** to review operations performed during execution.  
✅ **Clean and modular structure** using:

- `Number` (encapsulation of numerical values)
- `Calculator` (operations logic)
- `Menu` (console interface)
- `Record` (history management)
- `Operation` (operation types enum)
- `Main` (entry point)

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### **1️⃣ Compile**

Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
javac *.java
```

This will compile all Java files in the project.

### **2️⃣ Run**

After successful compilation, run:

```bash
java Main
```

You will see the interactive **calculator menu** appear in your console.

## 🖥️ How to Use

1️⃣ **Select the operation** you wish to perform from the menu:

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power, Square Root, Show History, Exit.

2️⃣ **Enter the numbers** as requested by the console.

- If you enter invalid input (letters or symbols), the system will prompt you to re-enter a valid number.

3️⃣ **View the result** displayed immediately after the operation.

4️⃣ After each operation:

- You will be asked if you want to perform the **same operation again** or return to the main menu.

5️⃣ You can **view the history** of performed operations at any time by selecting the "Show History" option in the menu.

6️⃣ To exit, select the "Exit" option in the main menu.
